Getting started
===============

.. note::
   Hey! Thanks for trying out Mars. We are still working on this section, so
   expect more content here in the future.

   While we build the documentation you are welcome to check out the code at
   `our github repository <https://github.com/EthWorks/Mars>`_. Maybe you fancy
   contributing?

To install mars use Yarn:

.. code-block::

   yarn add --dev ethereum-mars

or if you prefer you can use npm:

.. code-block::

   npm install --save-dev ethereum-mars
